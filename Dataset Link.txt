This dataset contains 5,863 chest X-ray images (JPEG), categorized into two classes: Pneumonia and Normal. It is organized into three folders: train, test, and validation, with subfolders for each category. The images were collected from pediatric patients aged one to five years at Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, China, as part of routine clinical care. All images are anterior-posterior (AP) views and underwent strict quality control, with low-quality or unreadable scans removed. Diagnoses were verified by two expert physicians, and the evaluation set was further reviewed by a third expert to minimize grading errors. This dataset is widely used in machine learning for binary classification tasks, particularly in training AI systems for pneumonia detection. For more details, visit the Kaggle dataset page.
